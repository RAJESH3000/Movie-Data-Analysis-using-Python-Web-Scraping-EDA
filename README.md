# Movie Data Analysis using Python, Web Scraping & EDA

## Project Overview
This project, developed by **Katlagunta Rajesh**, analyzes **global box office performance (1986–2025)** using data scraped from **Box Office Mojo**.  
It applies **Python, Web Scraping, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover meaningful insights about the film industry.  

## Tech Stack
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Web Scraping** → Requests, BeautifulSoup  
- **EDA & Visualization** → Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Steps
1. **Web Scraping** → Collected **8K+ rows** of movie data (worldwide, domestic, and foreign collections).  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** → Handled missing values, formatted columns, and created new features.  
3. **EDA & Visualization** → Analyzed revenue trends, correlation checks, and market comparisons using plots.  
4. **Insights Derived** →  
   - Top 10 and Bottom 10 movies by worldwide, domestic, and foreign collections.  
   - **COVID-19 impact** (sharp dip in 2020 global revenues).  
   - **Foreign markets overtook domestic** collections over time.  
   - **Blockbuster effect**: A few franchises (e.g., Titanic, Avatar, Avengers) dominate global box office.
